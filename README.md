CS496 Homework #2
=================

Create a cloud-based web app (using Google App Engine) that does the following:
1. Presents a form for posting the name of a university and the URL of a photo
2. Stores the university and the photo in the data store, along with the current
   date
3. Presents another page that displays the list of all universities and their
   photos
4. Runs an asynchronous task that deletes all universities and photos more than
   5 minutes old
5. Notice that you will need to deploy your app to GAE in order to run
   asynchronous tasks (part 4, above).

The app should work nicely in a computer web browser. Optional: Make it work
nicely in a mobile web browser, as well.
